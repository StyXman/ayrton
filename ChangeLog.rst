ayrton (0.5) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * source() is out. use python's import system.
  * Support executing foo.py().
  * Much better command detection.
  * CommandNotFound exception is now a subclass of NameError.
  * Allow Command keywords be named like '-l' and '--long-option', so it supports options with dashes.
  * This also means that long-option is no longer passed as --long-option; you have to put the dashes explicitly.
  * bash() does not return a single string by default; override with single=True.
  * Way more tests.
  * Updated docs.

ayrton (0.4.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix remote() a little. The API stills sucks.
  * Fix remote() tests.

ayrton (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * >= can redirect stederr to stdout.
  * o(option=argument) can be used to declare keyword params among/before 
    positional ones.
  * bash() now returns a single string if there is only one result.
  * Slightly better error reporting: don't print a part of the stacktrace
    that belongs to `ayrton` itself. There is still more to do.
  * No longer depends on `sh`.

ayrton (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The remote code (the body of a `with ssh (..): ...`) can be either pure
    Python or ayrton. Pure Python imposes less dependencies on the remote.
  * You can access the original `argv` in the remote.
  * More documentation, more examples, even some that are useful!
