The problem of licensing this code is not yet clear to me. I want it to be
equivalent to Bash (GPLv3, I guess), but as this is code that runs code on top
of code, I want to make sure that that's the proper license. Unitl I find it,
suffice to say that if you got this code, you can use it as it better fits your
needs, no strings attached.
