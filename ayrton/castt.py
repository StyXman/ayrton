    # The following constructs bind names:
    # [ ] formal parameters to functions,
    # [x] import statements,
    # [ ] class and function definitions (these bind the class or function name
    #     in the defining block),
    # [x] and targets that are identifiers if occurring in an assignment,
    # [ ] for loop header, or
    # [ ] after as in a with statement
    # [ ] or except clause.
    # The import statement of the form from ... import * binds all names defined
    # in the imported module, except those beginning with an underscore.

    # A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit.
    # The following are blocks:
    # [ ] a module,
    # [ ] a function body, and
    # [ ] a class definition.
    # [ ] A script file is a code block.
    # [ ] The string argument passed to the built-in functions eval() and exec()
    #     is a code block.

    # A scope defines the visibility of a name within a block. If a local variable
    # is defined in a block, its scope includes that block. If the definition
    # occurs in a function block, the scope extends to any blocks contained within
    # the defining one, unless a contained block introduces a different binding
    # for the name. The scope of names defined in a class block is limited to the
    # class block; it does not extend to the code blocks of methods â€“ this
    # includes comprehensions and generator expressions since they are implemented
    # using a function scope.

    # [ ] A target occurring in a del statement is also considered bound for this
    #     purpose (though the actual semantics are to unbind the name).
