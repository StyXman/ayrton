ayrton - a shell like language with the power of python

Thanks to:

`rbilstolfi`, `marianoguerra`, `facundobatista`, `ralsina`, `nessita` for unit
testing support, `Darni` for pointing me to
[nvie's workflow for `git`](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/),
Andrew Moffat for [`sh`](http://amoffat.github.io/sh/) and Richard Jones for
this talk (thanks again, `ralsina`), even when I ended up doing something
different:

Currently `ayrton` is under heavy development, so if you're following it and
clone it (there are no releases yet), use the branch `develop` (I'm also toying
with [nvie's branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)).
