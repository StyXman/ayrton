really do:
* finish expansions
* __bool__,
* check what happens to lists and dicts as executable params.
* export ENVVAR=foo (param _env)

* referencing non-existant envvars (FOO) is replaced by a Runner.
* more unit tests.
* tracing

* fix brace_expand().
* better error reporting
* revert commit 18e7bc5.
