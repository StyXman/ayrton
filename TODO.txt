really do:
* finish expansions
* export ENVVAR=foo (param _env)
* document
* renames? getcwd -> pwd, zip -> ziplist?
* enable tracing
* referencing non-existant envvars (FOO) is replaced by a Runner.
* more unit tests.
* with chdir(...)
* becareful with buitins, might eclipse valid usages: bash() (exp) blocks /bin/bash

if we {have time,are bored}:
* what to do about relative/absolute command paths?
* fix brace_expand().
* better error reporting
* revert commit 18e7bc5.
* redirection!
* &&, ||, |
