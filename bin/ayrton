usage="""ayrton - A Python-based shell-like scripting language.

Usage:

    ayrton -h
    ayrton -v
    ayrton [-c|--script] SCRIPT [argv ...]
    ayrton [-f|--file] file [argv ...]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c SCRIPT, --script SCRIPT
                        If this option is present, the script is read from its
                        argument.
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  [-f, --file] FILE     Name of the file from which the script is read.

Arguments:
  argv                  Arguments to be passed to the script."""

# argument parsing has to be done by hand, so arguments can be given to the script
# it *is* kinda idiotic, but I can't tell any of the parsing modules to just parse those options
# and the options are not many and are simple to handle, anyways
